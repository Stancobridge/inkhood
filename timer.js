/**
 *
 * x is count that can have any number from 0 to infinity 
 * m is x converted in minutes // x = 60m hence m = 1m
 * h is x converted to hour   // x = 7200s hence h = 2hrs
 * s: when x is between 0-60, s will be the same value of x, but at 61 s will return back to 0;
 * and start counting from there until x gets to 120,
 * s will return to 0 again, this will keep on repeating like music player count
